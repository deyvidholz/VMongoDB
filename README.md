# VMongoDB Paper Plugin

Simple MongoDB connector made for Minecraft Servers.

Change your database authorization settings in `config.yml`. Add this plugin as a dependency for projects that needs to connect to a MongoDB database. The main advantage to use this plugin as a central database connection is that it will make only one connection to the db and all the connection pools will be handled by this plugin only.
